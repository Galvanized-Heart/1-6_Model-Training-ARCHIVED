The loss function, often synonymous with the objective or cost function, is a crucial component in this process. They are mathematical formulations used to quantify the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual data. Or in other words, it evaluates the performance of the model for each input, quantifying how 'off' or 'wrong' the model's predictions are compared to the actual values. The goal of gradient descent is to minimize this function, thereby improving the model's accuracy. It may help to imagine the loss function as a hill, where you want to slowly traverse it based on its slope to find the lowest valley.\n",

        "\n",
        "Many of you might already have a solid foundation in statistics and are familiar with generalized mixed models, including logistic regression which extends from linear regression. However, the approach we're going to explore here differs slightly. As well, don't worry, those who have not taken these courses can also grasp the basic underlying steps that we will be highlighting here. When you potentially learned logistic regression in statistics, our focus was primarily on computing the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**closed-form**</span> solutions directly. These solutions provide exact answers derived from the mathematical equations of the model. However, it's important to recognize that computing closed-form solutions isn't always feasible or desirable, especially in certain contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, when dealing with large datasets, finding these closed-form solutions can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, in the realm of many machine learning models, closed-form solutions may not even exist due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. This is where alternative methods like gradient descent come into play. The use of gradient descent makes the training process adaptable and scalable for high-dimensional data, which is often the case in biology where datasets can include thousands of features from genetic markers to pixel data from medical images\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of gradient descent involves iteratively taking steps towards the minimum of the loss function. In the end, we have a model with its weight values set based on context from our dataset. However, to get there, each step through the loss function in this process has two essential aspects: its direction and its size.\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">-  **Direction:**</span> The direction of each step is determined by the gradient of the function at the current point. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent â€“ the direction in which the function increases most rapidly. However, since the goal is to minimize the function, gradient descent takes steps in the opposite direction of the gradient. By moving against the gradient, the algorithm descends towards the function's minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">-  **Size:**</span> The size of each step is proportional to the gradient. If the steps are too large, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum; if they are too small, the descent could be very slow or get stuck in a local minimum. The speed in which the model \"learns\" needs to be carefully chosen to ensure efficient and effective convergence to the minimum."

        "## Working with Gradient Descent\n",
        "\n",
        "To effectively utilize gradient descent, a significant part of our task involves determining the optimal frequency and magnitude of the steps we take. This brings us to the concept of <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**hyperparameters**</span>. Unlike model weights/parameters, which are learned from the data, hyperparameters are settings that we must define before training the model. All machine learning models have hyperparameters, with two common ones being the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**learning rate**</span> and the number of <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**epochs**</span>.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, gradient descent works by iteratively moving in the direction opposite to the gradient, with the magnitude of each step influenced by the learning rate. This iterative process continues until the algorithm <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**converges**</span>, which occurs when additional steps fail to significantly reduce the value of the loss function, suggesting that the minimum (or a local minimum) has been reached. The determination of step size and the total number of steps involves setting specific hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">- **Learning Rate (Alpha)**</span>: The learning rate, often denoted as alpha, controls the size of each step. A lower learning rate results in smaller steps, and a higher rate leads to larger steps. The choice of learning rate is crucial as it affects the performance of the model, influencing how quickly or slowly it converges to the minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">- **Epochs**</span>: An epoch, essentially an iteration, represents one complete pass through the entire dataset. The number of epochs determines how many times the model will traverse the gradient. Setting this number too low might prevent the model from reaching the minimum, while a very high number could lead to unnecessarily long training times. It's important to choose a value that allows the model to reach the minimum efficiently."

These represent the hyperparameters we can control: `max_iter` sets the number of epochs, dictating how many times the model will iterate over the dataset, and `alpha` specifies the learning rate. An example of this implementation was seen in week 5 with our analysis of the breast cancer dataset. Here, explicitly, we are using an alpha/learning rate of 0.00001 and 5 epochs."

For instance, a learning rate of 0.1 is not just slightly larger than 0.01; it's actually ten times larger. This significant increase can lead to very different training behaviors. A too high learning rate might cause the model to overshoot the minimum, while a too low learning rate might result in slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima.\n",

        "In this module, we explored the concept of \"training\" as it applies to logistic regression models. We delved into the gradient descent method, which is a common technique used by various machine learning models, including logistic regression, to minimize their loss function. This mathematical representation quantifies how \"correct\" our model's predictions are. Additionally, we discussed hyperparameters, which are variables set by us, the users, that influence the training process. This contrasts with the weights determined by the model during training. We also examined the role of a validation set. This set comprises data separated from the training dataset, used to refine hyperparameters effectively without relying on the test set, thereby avoiding the risk of overfitting. Lastly, we addressed the challenges associated with tuning hyperparameters, particularly the impact of choosing suboptimal learning rates and epoch numbers on the model's performance."
